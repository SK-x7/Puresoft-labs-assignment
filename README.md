# About the Project

This project was completed as part of the assignment provided by [PureSoft Labs OÃœ]. The requirements for this task were as follows:

- Task Objective:
To develop a responsive dashboard UI using Next.js v14.x App Router and TypeScript, based on a Figma design provided by the company.
- Key Instructions:
The app had to be mobile-responsive (no mobile design was provided, this was to test the frontend skills), with data dynamically fetched from a provided JSON file (no hardcoding allowed). A "Download" button was required to POST the api_secret to an API and download the Base64 image response.
- Ground Rule : The use of AI or assistance from others was strictly prohibited, and the app had to be hosted on Vercel.


## Features

- **Modern Design**: Built with Tailwind CSS for a clean and responsive design.
- **Dynamic Routing**: Powered by Next.js, providing seamless client- and server-side rendering.
- **Base64 Image Preview**: Displays and allows downloading of images encoded in Base64 format.
- **Sidebar Navigation**: A collapsible sidebar menu for easy navigation.
- **TypeScript Support**: Ensures type safety and better developer experience.
